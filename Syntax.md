# SAS Programming Methods and Basic Syntax
***
## Elements of SAS
SAS contains:
- statements  
- expressions
- functions and CALL routines
- options  
- formats  
- informats  

## Rules for SAS Statements
Whitespace, such as indentation of subordinate statements, extra spacing, and blank lines, are not required. 

There are only a few rules for writing SAS statements: 
- SAS statements end with a semicolon
- SAS statements are not casesensitive (can use upper, lower, or mixture of both cases)
- you can begin SAS statements in any column of a line and write several statements on the same line.
- Words in SAS are seperated by blanks or by special characters (i.e. +, -, etc.)

## Naming Convention
SAS names are used for SAS data set names, variable names, and other items. 
- Names can be 1 to 32 chars in length
- 1st char can be alphaNumeric or _
- remaining chars can be alphanumeric or _
- cannot contain spaces

## Variable Names, Special Rule
- var names are case-sensitive
